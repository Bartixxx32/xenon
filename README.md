# Welcome!

## Intro

The bot Xenon is based around the idea of creating & loading backups of your discord. Create backups of your channels, roles, permissions and messages and share them with other people. Just invite the bot and start now.

## Backups

Backups are used to save and duplicate your server. Backups are limited to the user that created it, but not limited to a server. That means you can use backups to move, or duplicate a server.

Every Backup has an unique id. It's generated by the bot while creating a backup. The id is used to load or get information about a backup. e.g. `p9b3neiq8i4olu56`

## Templates

Xenon gives you access to hundreds of free templates. In contrast to backups, templates are public and can be used by everyone.

Like backups, templates have a unique name. In contrast to backups that name isn't generated by the bot, but chosen by the creator of the template.

Everyone can create templates, if you have a server setup you want to share, feel free to create your own template.
